Quantum graphs are defined and various general properties are explored. In particular, the Schr√∂dinger equation is solved on the quantum snowflake graph, an infinite self-similar tree, in order to determine the graph's scattering properties. I.e.\ reflection and absorption for waves of varying energies that are sent into the snowflake graph are characterized.

By using the self-similarity and symmetries of the snowflake graph, a method is developed for reducing the snowflake graph to a line graph with special matching conditions. On this line graph, the complexity is further reduced by combining vertices into one meta-vertex. This procedure greatly simplifies the study of self-similar trees and gives a better understanding of the internal scattering of the graph.

Furthermore, it is shown that the periodic snowflake graph admits band gap structure, similar to crystalline materials. A recursive expression for the scattering coefficient for the general snowflake graph with $n$ generations is found.
